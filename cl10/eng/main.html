Entering such a storm means risking instrument failure, loss of control, severe turbulence, and potentially running out of fuel while lost, leading to a crash. The narrator takes this significant risk primarily due to his overwhelming desire to reach home quickly and enjoy his planned English breakfast.

Why do you think the description is apt for Horace? Why can&#039;the be categorised as a typical thief?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> There is no doubt that Horace Danby was a good and respectable citizen as he used to run a successful business of lock-making and did well enough to engage two helpers and a housekeeper. However, he cannot be considered completely honest as he indulged in stealing, even though only once in a year. His integrity merits suspicion as he had served a sentence in a prison library fifteen years ago. Hence his description as a man who is not completely honest is true. However, it will be wrong to consider him a typical thief because he would steal only from rich people and just once a year. He did not earn his livelihood out of it and took to stealing to be able to afford his costly hobby to collect rare and expensive books, which he could not have managed out of his modest income as a maker of locks.</p></div>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"Horace Danby was a meticulous planner, but still he faltered.

Though he is basically good at heart, he is strict and wants to maintain proper discipline in the class. He does not allow Anne to talk excessively in the class. As a dedicated teacher, he remains firm in improving her behaviour because he wants his students to do well in life. When all his persuasions fail to change the girl, he thinks of a unique method to correct her. He assigns her additional homework and tells her to write an essay on the topic &quot;A Chatterbox&quot;. This shows that he is an ideal teacher who knows the skill of channelizing the energies of his students in a positive way. He continues to assign &#039;additional homework&#039; on this topic till Anne comes up with a creative poem. Mr Keesing is a genuine and warm person, so he takes Anne&#039;s jokes very sportingly. He laughs at the poem about the father swan biting his talkative ducklings to death and even reads it to other students. He admires Anne&#039;s creative skill and allows her to talk in the class, without holding any angst against her. His tough outward appearance has a tender heart inside. He is a teacher who always has the welfare of his students in his mind and loves them dearly. In sum, he is a lovable character having some pardonable shortcomings.</em>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"What made writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?
