How long does he wait there and why?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The author, Gavin Maxwell, goes to Basra to the Consulate-General to collect and answer his mail from Europe. He goes there with his friend who too makes this visit to check whether his mail has arrived or not. Maxwell learns that his mail has not yet arrived while his friend gets his mail in time. So, Max sends a cable to England to which he does not get response even three days later. He then tries to contact telephonically. The call has to be booked twenty-four hours in advance. On the first day, the line is out of order and on the second day the exchange is closed for a religious holiday. On the third day there is another breakdown. Therefore, he is forced to wait at the Consulate for five days after which his mail arrives."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does the author get the otter? Does he like it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Maxwell was very sad when his pet dog Jonnie died. He felt so miserable that he could not think of keeping a dog again as his pet. He used to live in Camusfearna which was very close to the sea and an idea crossed his mind that he should keep an otter as a pet. He casually mentioned this to his friend who was accompanying him to Basra. This friend knew that the Tigris marshes had abundant otters and he sent one to Max through two Arabs. The Arabs brought the otter in a sack and placed it on the floor of Max's bedroom in the Consulate. Max took fancy to the animal the moment the sack was opened. He admitted that this started an endless phase in his life where he adored and loved otters. So much so that he developed a thraldom to otters which was something like otter fixation. He spent one full month to clean the mud from the otter's fur to reveal his real soft, shining, chocolate-coloured coat. He loved him and cared for him as one cares for a child. He thus developed a strong liking for it."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happened when Maxwell took Mijbil to the bathroom? What did Mijbil do two days later?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Maxwell made a body-belt for Mijbil and took him on a lead to the bathroom. The animal was beside himself with joy when he saw water. He plunged and rolled in the bathtub, and shot up and down its length splashing and sloshing water all over. It appeared as though the water had been spilled by a huge hippo rather than by a small otter. Mijbil was an otter, a species that has characteristic fascination for water. Otters love to scatter and spread every drop of water. They feel tempted to overturn every bowl of water. Two days later, Mijbil escaped into the bathroom and climbed to the end of the bathtub to reach the chromium taps. He managed to turn them on using his paws to first get a trickle and then a full flow."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"During Maxwell's stay in London, what game did Mij invent for himself? What light does this invention reflect on him?\nOr\nHow did Mij pass his time in London with the author? What became his favourite game?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"During Maxwell's stay in London, Mij invented a game with the ping-pong ball. For this, he used one of Max's suitcases that had got damaged. The lid of the suitcase remained at a slope from one end to the other when closed. Mij used to place the ping-pong ball on the high end to let it slide down the length of the suitcase. Before the ball went down the slope, he would dash around to the other end and stop it, hide from it, crouching to spring up and take it by surprise. Then he would grab it and trot off with it to the high end again. He would keep himself engrossed in this game for up to half an hour at a time. The invention of such a game shows that Mijbil was a very intelligent creature who loved to have a lot of fun."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are compulsive habits? What, according to Maxwell, are the compulsive habits of: (i) School children (ii) Mijbil, the otter","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Compulsive habits are the actions that are performed repetitively and regularly simply because the individual cannot hold himself from not doing them. These habits are like rituals that are performed effortlessly, frequently and involuntarily. An example is that children place their feet squarely on the centre of each paving block and touch every seventh upright of the railing on their way to and back from school. Similarly, Mijbil also got into the habit of jumping on to a two feet high boundary wall of the primary school opposite Maxwell's flat. He would tug his master towards the wall, climb it and gallop over its full length of thirty yards. He did this every day on their way back home after the walk."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Give an account of Mijbil's stay with Maxwell in Iraq.","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The moment the author saw the otter, he developed a sort of a fixation for it. The mud-laden creature was cleaned by Maxwell with love, care and patience. The otter took some time before befriending Max. During the first twenty-four hours he remained aloof and indifferent. He stayed as far as possible from the author's bed. However, the very next day, he chose to sleep in the crook of Max's knees. Soon, he started taking a keen interest in his surroundings. When the author took him to the bathroom, he was beside itself with joy at the sight of water. He played splashing and sloshing it. Two days later, he learnt to turn on the tap with his paws. He would chitter with irritation and disappointment whenever he would turn the tap the wrong way and tighten it. All through his stay in Iraq, the otter played with toys like a rubber ball and marbles. He would lie on his back and juggle with small objects between his paws."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Q9. Give an idea of the eventful journey of Mijbil from Basra to London.\nOr\nWhat did Maxwell do to transport Mijbil to England? How did Mijbil behave during his flight?\nOr\nWhat happened to Mij before the flight to Paris? What commotion did he create in the aircraft?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"After having finished his work in Basra, Maxwell decided to return to London. But he was faced with the difficulty to transport Mijbil with him since the British airways did not fly animals. Maxwell then booked a flight to Paris with another airline and from there to London. This airline however, told Maxwell to put Mij in an eighteen inches square box and place it at his feet during the flight. So Max got the box made and put Mijbil in it an hour before leaving for the airport to familiarize him to the closed box. Mij, however, didn't like this confined place and struggled to get out. In doing so, he ripped the inner lining of the box to shreds and hurt himself badly. Max spent some time removing all sharp shreds and carried Mij in the same box to the airport. In the plane, on the airhostess' suggestion, Max opened the box to carry Mij on his knees. But, the otter rushed out towards other passengers the minute the box was opened. It created a lot of commotion in the plane. A scared woman got on her seat and screamed \"A rat! A rat!\" and there were shrieks and squawks all over. Max tried to dive at Mij to catch him but missed the otter and landed with his face in the curry. However, the kind airhostess calmed down Max and told him to get seated while she tried to get back Mij. A while later, the naughty otter returned to Max and bound to his knee making a distressed chitter and nuzzling his face and neck. Thus, the eventful journey from Basra to London via Paris became a memorable one not only for Maxwell but also for his co-passengers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are some of the things we come to know about otters from this text?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The account tells us that otters are found in abundance mainly in the Tigris marshes of Iraq. These animals have a compulsive weakness for water. They love to splash and play with it. They are cautious while befriending human beings but once they begin to trust, they develop permanent affection and friendship.\n\nOtters are fun-loving, childlike creatures and are intelligent enough to invent their own games. They are curious and soon learn new things. They love to spend their time in playing with toys. They have a strong sense of survival and try hard to protect themselves. They are friendly, loving and loyal and are fit to be adopted as pets. In due course of time they start responding to their names. They eat fish and can be trained like dogs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What things does Mij do which tell you that he is an intelligent, friendly and fun-loving animal who needs love?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There is no doubt that Mij is an intelligent, friendly and a fun-loving animal who is also affectionate. His intelligence is proved from the fact that he does not surrender himself to the author till he finds him trustworthy. He stays aloof and away from him for the first twenty-four hours. The ping-pong ball game that he invents for himself also shows that he is intelligent. His ability to turn on the taps with his paws is another evidence of the brilliance of his mind.\n\nHis fun-loving nature is revealed when he splashes water by plunging and rolling in the bathtub. This aspect of his nature becomes clearer when he ambushes the sliding ping-pong ball and hides from it to take it by surprise.\n\nHis warm friendliness is obvious throughout the entire story. The way he bounds on the author’s knees in the plane and nuzzles his face and neck show that he is friendly and loving."}}]}</script><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/atom-one-dark.min.css"> <script src="https://tikzjax.com/v1/tikzjax.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/highlight.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js"></script><script>MathJax = {tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\(', '\)']], displayMath: [['$$', '$$'], ['\[', '\]']]}, svg: {fontCache: 'global'}};</script><script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script><style>

<h1>MIJBIL THE OTTER</h1>
<h3>Long Answer Questions</h3>
<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="Why does the author go to Basra? How long does he wait there and why?" data-answer="The author, Gavin Maxwell, goes to Basra to the Consulate-General to collect and answer his mail from Europe. He goes there with his friend who too makes this visit to check whether his mail has arrived or not. Maxwell learns that his mail has not yet arrived while his friend gets his mail in time. So, Max sends a cable to England to which he does not get response even three days later. He then tries to contact telephonically. The call has to be booked twenty-four hours in advance. On the first day, the line is out of order and on the second day the exchange is closed for a religious holiday. On the third day there is another breakdown. Therefore, he is forced to wait at the Consulate for five days after which his mail arrives."><p><strong>Q:</strong> Why does the author go to Basra?

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="How does the author get the otter? Does he like it?" data-answer="Maxwell was very sad when his pet dog Jonnie died. He felt so miserable that he could not think of keeping a dog again as his pet. He used to live in Camusfearna which was very close to the sea and an idea crossed his mind that he should keep an otter as a pet. He casually mentioned this to his friend who was accompanying him to Basra. This friend knew that the Tigris marshes had abundant otters and he sent one to Max through two Arabs. The Arabs brought the otter in a sack and placed it on the floor of Max&#039;s bedroom in the Consulate. Max took fancy to the animal the moment the sack was opened. He admitted that this started an endless phase in his life where he adored and loved otters. So much so that he developed a thraldom to otters which was something like otter fixation. He spent one full month to clean the mud from the otter&#039;s fur to reveal his real soft, shining, chocolate-coloured coat. He loved him and cared for him as one cares for a child. He thus developed a strong liking for it."><p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the author get the otter? Does he like it?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Maxwell was very sad when his pet dog Jonnie died.

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="What happened when Maxwell took Mijbil to the bathroom? What did Mijbil do two days later?" data-answer="Maxwell made a body-belt for Mijbil and took him on a lead to the bathroom. The animal was beside himself with joy when he saw water. He plunged and rolled in the bathtub, and shot up and down its length splashing and sloshing water all over. It appeared as though the water had been spilled by a huge hippo rather than by a small otter. Mijbil was an otter, a species that has characteristic fascination for water. Otters love to scatter and spread every drop of water. They feel tempted to overturn every bowl of water. Two days later, Mijbil escaped into the bathroom and climbed to the end of the bathtub to reach the chromium taps. He managed to turn them on using his paws to first get a trickle and then a full flow."><p><strong>Q:</strong> What happened when Maxwell took Mijbil to the bathroom?

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="During Maxwell&#039;s stay in London, what game did Mij invent for himself? What light does this invention reflect on him?
Or
How did Mij pass his time in London with the author? What became his favourite game?" data-answer="During Maxwell&#039;s stay in London, Mij invented a game with the ping-pong ball. For this, he used one of Max&#039;s suitcases that had got damaged. The lid of the suitcase remained at a slope from one end to the other when closed. Mij used to place the ping-pong ball on the high end to let it slide down the length of the suitcase. Before the ball went down the slope, he would dash around to the other end and stop it, hide from it, crouching to spring up and take it by surprise. Then he would grab it and trot off with it to the high end again. He would keep himself engrossed in this game for up to half an hour at a time. The invention of such a game shows that Mijbil was a very intelligent creature who loved to have a lot of fun."><p><strong>Q:</strong> During Maxwell&#039;s stay in London, what game did Mij invent for himself?

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="What are compulsive habits? What, according to Maxwell, are the compulsive habits of: (i) School children (ii) Mijbil, the otter" data-answer="Compulsive habits are the actions that are performed repetitively and regularly simply because the individual cannot hold himself from not doing them. These habits are like rituals that are performed effortlessly, frequently and involuntarily. An example is that children place their feet squarely on the centre of each paving block and touch every seventh upright of the railing on their way to and back from school. Similarly, Mijbil also got into the habit of jumping on to a two feet high boundary wall of the primary school opposite Maxwell&#039;s flat. He would tug his master towards the wall, climb it and gallop over its full length of thirty yards. He did this every day on their way back home after the walk."><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are compulsive habits?

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="Give an account of Mijbil&#039;s stay with Maxwell in Iraq." data-answer="The moment the author saw the otter, he developed a sort of a fixation for it. The mud-laden creature was cleaned by Maxwell with love, care and patience. The otter took some time before befriending Max. During the first twenty-four hours he remained aloof and indifferent. He stayed as far as possible from the author&#039;s bed. However, the very next day, he chose to sleep in the crook of Max&#039;s knees. Soon, he started taking a keen interest in his surroundings. When the author took him to the bathroom, he was beside itself with joy at the sight of water. He played splashing and sloshing it. Two days later, he learnt to turn on the tap with his paws. He would chitter with irritation and disappointment whenever he would turn the tap the wrong way and tighten it. All through his stay in Iraq, the otter played with toys like a rubber ball and marbles. He would lie on his back and juggle with small objects between his paws."><p><strong>Q:</strong> Give an account of Mijbil&#039;s stay with Maxwell in Iraq.</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The moment the author saw the otter, he developed a sort of a fixation for it.

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="Q9. Give an idea of the eventful journey of Mijbil from Basra to London.
Or
What did Maxwell do to transport Mijbil to England? How did Mijbil behave during his flight?
Or
What happened to Mij before the flight to Paris? What commotion did he create in the aircraft?" data-answer="After having finished his work in Basra, Maxwell decided to return to London. But he was faced with the difficulty to transport Mijbil with him since the British airways did not fly animals. Maxwell then booked a flight to Paris with another airline and from there to London. This airline however, told Maxwell to put Mij in an eighteen inches square box and place it at his feet during the flight. So Max got the box made and put Mijbil in it an hour before leaving for the airport to familiarize him to the closed box. Mij, however, didn&#039;t like this confined place and struggled to get out. In doing so, he ripped the inner lining of the box to shreds and hurt himself badly. Max spent some time removing all sharp shreds and carried Mij in the same box to the airport. In the plane, on the airhostess&#039; suggestion, Max opened the box to carry Mij on his knees. But, the otter rushed out towards other passengers the minute the box was opened. It created a lot of commotion in the plane. A scared woman got on her seat and screamed &quot;A rat! A rat!&quot; and there were shrieks and squawks all over. Max tried to dive at Mij to catch him but missed the otter and landed with his face in the curry. However, the kind airhostess calmed down Max and told him to get seated while she tried to get back Mij. A while later, the naughty otter returned to Max and bound to his knee making a distressed chitter and nuzzling his face and neck. Thus, the eventful journey from Basra to London via Paris became a memorable one not only for Maxwell but also for his co-passengers."><p><strong>Q:</strong>  Give an idea of the eventful journey of Mijbil from Basra to London.

<div class="qa-block" data-qa-type="qa" data-question="What are some of the things we come to know about otters from this text?" data-answer="The account tells us that otters are found in abundance mainly in the Tigris marshes of Iraq. These animals have a compulsive weakness for water. They love to splash and play with it. They are cautious while befriending human beings but once they begin to trust, they develop permanent affection and friendship.

Otters are fun-loving, childlike creatures and are intelligent enough to invent their own games. They are curious and soon learn new things. They love to spend their time in playing with toys. They have a strong sense of survival and try hard to protect themselves. They are friendly, loving and loyal and are fit to be adopted as pets. In due course of time they start responding to their names. They eat fish and can be trained like dogs."><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are some of the things we come to know about otters from this text?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The account tells us that otters are found in abundance mainly in the Tigris marshes of Iraq.

His intelligence is proved from the fact that he does not surrender himself to the author till he finds him trustworthy. He stays aloof and away from him for the first twenty-four hours. The ping-pong ball game that he invents for himself also shows that he is intelligent. His ability to turn on the taps with his paws is another evidence of the brilliance of his mind.

His fun-loving nature is revealed when he splashes water by plunging and rolling in the bathtub. This aspect of his nature becomes clearer when he ambushes the sliding ping-pong ball and hides from it to take it by surprise.

His warm friendliness is obvious throughout the entire story. The way he bounds on the author’s knees in the plane and nuzzles his face and neck show that he is friendly and loving."><p><strong>Q:</strong> What things does Mij do which tell you that he is an intelligent, friendly and fun-loving animal who needs love?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> There is no doubt that Mij is an intelligent, friendly and a fun-loving animal who is also affectionate.

People usually living away from forests cannot identify them easily. The poet, Carolyn Wells, presents these wild animals as distinct from each other because of their distinct physical appearances and their behaviours.\n        The Asian Lions, found in the eastern countries, are huge in size and have a dull brown skin. They can frighten a victim to death as they roar loudly.  A Bengal Tiger can be distinguished from other animals by its yellow skin having black stripes on it. Very humorously, the poet remarks that if the beast comes to eat a person, he can be very definite that it is no other animal except a Bengal Tiger. It pounces upon its prey for food.\n         A Leopard can be identified by its skin having spots. The pale straw coloured coat with solid dark spots makes a peppery pattern . The animal can be recognized as a leopard if it jumps on the victim again and again. The poet wittily remarks that it is a leopard because it 'leaps' and 'leaps' on a person implying that it leaps repeatedly on the person it encounters till the person is killed .\n    Thus, the poet presents a vivid description of an Asian Lion, a Bengal Tiger and a Leopard to help the reader to identify them and beware of them .</p></div>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"How does the poet portray a bear, a hyena, a crocodile, and a chameleon?Or What behavioural traits of a bear, a hyena, a crocodile and a chameleon are described by the poet?\" data-answer=\"The poet does not discuss the physical appearance of a bear, a hyena and a crocodile .

The title is followed by a mark of exclamation which indicates that Amanda is being addressed and commanded. The punctuation mark reveals the authoritative, dominating, unsympathetic tone adopted by the mother in addressing her daughter.</li></ul>\n<h3>Style of the Poem</h3>\n<ul><li>The poem has a conversational style where only one speaker, that is the mother, voices her views. The thoughts of the child which are put in parenthesis are not uttered. The child seems to be listening in silence but in reality her imagination, which is fast at work, transports her from her home, to sea, to the roadside, to an old castle and thus she wishes to escape the perpetual nagging by the mother.</li><li>In the five stanzas uttered by the mother, Amanda&#039;s name appears twelve times. Each of these stanzas gives jolts and jerks to the child, hence the stanzas spoken by the mother are written in free verse but the poet has used rhyme scheme for the thoughts of the child, who imagines a blissful life full of liberty and joy.</li></ul>\n<h3>THEME</h3>\n<ul><li>The poem deals with child psychology as well as the lack of insight on the part of elders to understand children&#039;s thought process. The poem seems to suggest that the more children are suppressed, the more defiant they become. Such children start finding reality to be harsh and find escape in day-dreaming or imagination, so much so that they start wishing for a life without parents around them to curtail their liberty. The poem indirectly advises the parents to have healthy and friendly relations with children which may be more effective in grooming them properly.</li><li>However, the poem also indirectly emphasizes the need for children to listen to the advice of their elders and not to escape reality. Children can learn to do so if they are treated with affection and given some liberty, for suppression results in defiance.</li></ul>\n<h3>SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS</h3>\n<div class=qa-block data-qa-type=qa data-question=\"How old do you think Amanda is?
