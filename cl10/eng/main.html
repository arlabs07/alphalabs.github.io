People usually living away from forests cannot identify them easily. The poet, Carolyn Wells, presents these wild animals as distinct from each other because of their distinct physical appearances and their behaviours.\n        The Asian Lions, found in the eastern countries, are huge in size and have a dull brown skin. They can frighten a victim to death as they roar loudly.  A Bengal Tiger can be distinguished from other animals by its yellow skin having black stripes on it. Very humorously, the poet remarks that if the beast comes to eat a person, he can be very definite that it is no other animal except a Bengal Tiger. It pounces upon its prey for food.\n         A Leopard can be identified by its skin having spots. The pale straw coloured coat with solid dark spots makes a peppery pattern . The animal can be recognized as a leopard if it jumps on the victim again and again. The poet wittily remarks that it is a leopard because it 'leaps' and 'leaps' on a person implying that it leaps repeatedly on the person it encounters till the person is killed .\n    Thus, the poet presents a vivid description of an Asian Lion, a Bengal Tiger and a Leopard to help the reader to identify them and beware of them .</p></div>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"How does the poet portray a bear, a hyena, a crocodile, and a chameleon?Or What behavioural traits of a bear, a hyena, a crocodile and a chameleon are described by the poet?\" data-answer=\"The poet does not discuss the physical appearance of a bear, a hyena and a crocodile .

The title is followed by a mark of exclamation which indicates that Amanda is being addressed and commanded. The punctuation mark reveals the authoritative, dominating, unsympathetic tone adopted by the mother in addressing her daughter.</li></ul>\n<h3>Style of the Poem</h3>\n<ul><li>The poem has a conversational style where only one speaker, that is the mother, voices her views. The thoughts of the child which are put in parenthesis are not uttered. The child seems to be listening in silence but in reality her imagination, which is fast at work, transports her from her home, to sea, to the roadside, to an old castle and thus she wishes to escape the perpetual nagging by the mother.</li><li>In the five stanzas uttered by the mother, Amanda&#039;s name appears twelve times. Each of these stanzas gives jolts and jerks to the child, hence the stanzas spoken by the mother are written in free verse but the poet has used rhyme scheme for the thoughts of the child, who imagines a blissful life full of liberty and joy.</li></ul>\n<h3>THEME</h3>\n<ul><li>The poem deals with child psychology as well as the lack of insight on the part of elders to understand children&#039;s thought process. The poem seems to suggest that the more children are suppressed, the more defiant they become. Such children start finding reality to be harsh and find escape in day-dreaming or imagination, so much so that they start wishing for a life without parents around them to curtail their liberty. The poem indirectly advises the parents to have healthy and friendly relations with children which may be more effective in grooming them properly.</li><li>However, the poem also indirectly emphasizes the need for children to listen to the advice of their elders and not to escape reality. Children can learn to do so if they are treated with affection and given some liberty, for suppression results in defiance.</li></ul>\n<h3>SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS</h3>\n<div class=qa-block data-qa-type=qa data-question=\"How old do you think Amanda is?

Give reasons in support of your answer.</p><p><strong>A:</strong> There is no denying the fact that Goan bread, Coorgi culture and Assam tea - all have foreign origins but have assimilated into Indian culture and traditions. The Goan bread is the legacy that the Portuguese invaders and erstwhile rulers of Goa have left behind. Coorg got its culture of valour and customs from the Greeks or the Arabs. The Assam tea, too, came to India from China.\nAlthough each of these items travelled to us from other parts of the world but now they are an essential part of our life. A traditional Goan village cannot imagine life without &#039;paders&#039; and their Portuguese way of baking special loaves. Coorgis have cultures and customs distinct from the mainstream Hindus but they form one of the most decorated units of Indian Army. Assam has the largest concentration of tea plantations in the world. All these places have their unique identity but are essentially Indian in character.</p></div>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"Justify the title of the chapter &quot;Glimpses of India.&quot;\" data-answer=\"A glimpse is a brief or a partial view of an object, a place, or a person.

She has many qualities that make her an amazing young person. For example, she is a happy child, although she does not have any playmates. She is very observant and keeps watching the scenes in the street outside her house. The same sense of observation is perceptible when she views the interior of the bus, the scene outside the window, the sight of the cow in panic, the scene of the town market, and the cow lying dead by the side of the road.<br>\nValli is essentially a dreamer who makes efforts to realize her dreams. She dreams of going on a bus journey to the nearest town and plans it intelligently. She saves money for it and executes her plan neatly without her mother getting even a hint of it.<br>\nValli has a very confident and a nonchalant demeanour. Her speech exudes confidence that looks odd but fascinating for a girl of her age. She considers herself grown up, and speaks with the conductor and fellow passengers with panache. However, she easily gets annoyed and irritated if others poke their noses in her business and ask her too many questions. In particular, she chooses to give the old woman passenger a piece of her mind when the latter keeps probing her. At times, she appears to be rude, haughty and commanding, but at heart she is very sensitive and fun-loving.<br>\nShe is easily affected by what goes on around her. If the sight of the cow running in panic with its tail up in the air can fill her with joy, she becomes very serious and sad on seeing the same cow dead by the roadside.<be>\nValli plans cleverly and saves meticulously. She resists all sorts of temptations in order to save enough money for her bus ride. Her plan of the journey is flawless and her ability to take care of herself is exceptional. She has the courage to say ‘no’ whenever necessary. For example, she turns down the conductor’s offer of a cold drink.\nOverall, Valli is a delightful girl who is intelligent, mature and capable of looking after herself. She is cheerful and curious by nature and has her way with the people as well as her plans.\n</p>\n<Br>\n<strong>The Conductor</strong>\n<p>\nThe unnamed bus conductor in the story is a man of cheerful disposition. Not many conductors are as helpful as he is. He is surprised to find an eight year Valli wanting to travel all by herself. He greets her cheerfully and helps her board the bus. He is truly impressed with her self-confidence and assertiveness. That is why he calls her a ‘Madam’. On the way to the town, he tries his best to keep her in good humour and does not mind when she gets irritated and annoyed on account of the fun he has at her expense.<br>\nOnce the bus reaches the town, he is surprised to find out that the girl does not want to get down to go around the town market and that she intends to return home by the same bus. Thinking that she must be tired and thirsty, he even offers to buy her a cold-drink, which she declines. On the way back, he readily answers all her questions about the dead cow. This shows that he loves children and is patient with them.<br>\nIn short, the conductor is a good-natured, cheerful man who enjoys his work and who knows how to take care of his passengers, especially child-passengers. He is very nice to Valli and takes good care of her. He even invites her to come again for another bus ride.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Question answers</h3>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"Why do you think standing in front of her doorway and watching what was happening on the street became Valli&#039;s favourite pastime?\" data-answer=\"Valli had no playmates of her own age in the neighbourhood.

She is born fair and pretty and gets a meaningful name, Sulekha. But misfortunes befall her early in life and she suffers a head injury at the age of ten months. This slows down her reflexes and she is unable to talk like normal children. To make matters worse, she has a severe attack of small-pox at the age of two which disfigures her face and leaves deep black pock-marks. Eventually when she begins to learn talking by the age of five, she stammers a lot and has to bear the ridicule of others. This inhibits her personality and she becomes a withdrawn child with an inferiority complex. Nicknamed Bholi, which means a &#039;simpleton&#039;, this promising young girl grows up in an environment where even her family does not care for her. This develops in her a sense of fear and insecurity. <Br> A positive change comes to her life when she begins her education at the village primary school. Although she is ill-at-ease in her class, she gradually overcomes her complexes under the loving guidance of her teacher. The Bholi that the reader encounters in the end is a compassionate, intelligent and self-respecting young girl justifying her name Sulekha. She commands respect by asserting herself and by refusing to succumb to social pressures. This inspiring character earns both love and respect of the readers.</p>\n<strong>Ramlal, the &#039;Numberdar&#039;</strong>\n<P>\n\nRamlal is a middle-aged, prosperous farmer, who is also the 'Numberdar' of the village. Although a representative of the government, he is conservative and does not believe in literacy of girls. He spends money only on the education of his three sons and sends his youngest daughter Bholi to school just to appease his superior, the Tehsildar. <Br>Ramlal is very cautious about his social status and urges his wife to dress up Bholi properly so that the teachers and students of school do not question his position. He is also afraid of annoying his wife and therefore consults her on all vital issues. Often, he agrees to her suggestions even if he is not fully convinced. He agrees to marry off Bholi to an elderly widower only because his wife insists so. He submits to social pressures and agrees to give dowry at his daughter's wedding at the insistence of the groom because he feels ashamed to send away the wedding-party without solemnizing the marriage. <Br> On the whole, he is a typical middle-class man who conforms to patriarchal practices without trying to analyse the pros or cons of age old traditions.\n</p>\n<strong>The Teacher</strong>\n<P>\nThe teacher appears very briefly in the story, but her appearance is of such vital importance that it changes the entire course of Bholi's life. She is a patient, loving, caring and considerate person and has all the qualities of a good teacher. She understands the psychology of children, particularly of those children who are differently-abled and slow-learners like Bholi. She helps Bholi to overcome her fears and slowly instills confidence in her. It is under her guidance that Bholi learns to talk without stammering.<br>\nThe teacher is sensitive like an artist, and treats her students as pure mediums through which she can express her valuable thoughts. Thus she admires Bholi towards the end of the story as if she were her masterpiece. In short, she is an ideal teacher, devoted to her students and is responsible for Bholi's transformation.</p>\n<h3>Question answer</h3>\n<div class=\"qa-block\" data-qa-type=\"qa\" data-question=\"For what unusual reasons was Bholi sent to school?
